<h1>Summary</h1>
Cavelike is a roguelike game where you are exploring the mysterious caves.
The goal is to go as deep as you can without getting killed by the monsters inside the cave.
Every floor has a portal on the bottom line of islands, this portal will bring you to the shop where you can upgrade yourself so you are ready to slay some monsters.
But how are you going to pay? No worries the monsters you kill will drop you some cash and if you are lucky you will come across a secret treasure chest with even more cash!
